## Description of the Main Idea

We will create a translator that accepts Python code and outputs a version that has been translated to Java. The resulting Java program will have the same output and exact same functionality as the original Python program.

## Description of the Tasks that You Will Complete

To create a program that translates Python code to JavaScript code. The program could incorporate aspects of both programming languages, such as data types, loops, and functions. The translator could use a combination of parsing techniques and regular expressions to identify the structure of the Python code and generate the equivalent JavaScript code. To test the program, you could write a set of Python test cases that cover a range of Python features, and then verify that the translated JavaScript code produces the same output as the original Python code.

## Detailed Plan for Your Team to Complete the Project with a Timeline

A high-level overview of the steps involved in building such a translator:

- Develop a parser for Python code using a tool like ANTLR or pyparsing. This parser should be able to parse Python code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

- Write a translator that converts the Python AST into a JavaScript AST. This step involves mapping each Python AST node to a corresponding JavaScript AST node.

- Generate JavaScript code from the JavaScript AST. This can be done using a tool like escodegen.

- Write a test suite for your translator, which includes Python code snippets that test a range of Python features.

- Verify that the generated JavaScript code produces the same output as the original Python code.
